## Donald Trump is...

### ...too old
### ...too crazy
### ...too strange
### ...too threatening to our democracy.


We must not elect Trump as the next president. He's not the only one who is a threat to America - he's the tip of the authoritarian iceberg we're steaming towards. We must not elect any other MAGA candidates or people advocating Christian Nationalism. Our democracy and our freedoms are at stake!

> "When fascism comes... it will appear rather in the luminous robes of flaming patriotism; it will take some genuinely indigenous shape and color"

-- John Thomas Flynn _As We Go Marching_, 1944.

> "[Fascism will be] wrapped up in the American flag and heralded as a plea for liberty and preservation of the constitution." 

-- James Waterman Wise Jr, _Sermon Address_, 1936.

Make sure you vote this election. Tell your friends and family to vote. If anyone is undecided then help them decide. Trump can and must be stopped at the ballot box.
