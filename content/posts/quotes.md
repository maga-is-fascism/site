While looking for a quote for the home page I wanted to use this classic:

> When fascism comes to America, it will be wrapped in the flag and carrying a cross.

It's pithy and conveys my message exactly. It's a truth we need to hear in the 2024 election campaign where there is a whole movement of Christofascists (or Christian Nationalists). You might know the movement as MAGA or "Make America Great Again". 

The trouble with using the quote above is [it doesn't seem like anyone actually said it verbatim](https://relevantmagazine.com/culture/books/who-really-said-when-fascism-comes-to-america-it-will-be-wrapped-in-the-flag-and-carrying-a-cross-1/). If anyone said or wrote those exact words [Snopes concludes that we don't know who](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/sinclair-lewis-fascism-warning/). I've looked up some similar quotes to use on the front page. I believe in absolute truth, not make up whatever you want to believe so I needed to use real quotes on my homepage not a made up one.

I am a committed Christian who wants America to be a successful country. But Christian Nationalism isn't the way to achieve this. Check the video below for an explainer on why it would be a disaster. Spoiler: it's the fascism part that's a huge problem.

Religious freedom is part of the foundational values of America. It's important even for Christians. Freedom of religion was originally a Protestant Christian idea so they could practice their beliefs without interference from the Catholic Church or Church of England. I don't want to be branded a heretic and persecuted for my religious practice if it's different to the MAGA state sanctioned Christianity.
